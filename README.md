assignment 2 - commitment

For this assignment, I created a blog post to show my work for my Object-ATLS 3300 class. I used my index.html as a portal hub so I can also showcase my porfolio for my Form-ATLS 3100 class (Site hasn't been built yet, but hope to bring in my old porfolio site I made in ATLS 2200-WEB). I also included an about me and contact section at the bottom of the portal hub. I made sure to make the formatting/orientation of the web contents responsive to screen size (you should be able to shrink your web browser to whatever size and everything should still be legible).
