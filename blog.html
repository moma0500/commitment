      <p id="blogText">For this first lab, we were assigned to make a series and parallel circuit that lit two LEDs. The first thing I did was draw a flow diagram for both circuits and calculated the necessary resistor values to light the LEDs, as
        seen below:</p>

      <p id="blogText">I then used my breadboard to wire everything up. I first started with my parallel circuit and used the button provided in the ELEGOO starter kit as my switch. I then moved on to my series circuit. Here, I used a quarter to
        replace the button:</p>

      <p id="blogText">After this, I created an enclosure for the series circuit with the quarter switch. I had the packaging to my new headphones lying around and thought this would be a great enclosure since it fit the Arduino and breadboard
        perfectly. Once I placed everything in the box, I marked some holes where I wanted the LEDs, plug for the Arduino, and switch to be outside of the box. I then rewired the circuit a bit so I could fully open the box without ripping out the
        wires and allow the LEDs to poke out. I just used the ELEGOO provided wires and taped them to the LEDs to make them poke out.</p>
